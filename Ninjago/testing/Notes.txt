Run units.py. This will give you a folder named "units" of 128-byte-long files. The hex addresses below
refer to locations in those files.

0x0D seems to be speed. Here are some examples and their stars:
- 0x26 = 38 = 0.5 stars
- 0x2A = 42 = 0.5 stars
- 0x30 = 48 = 1 star
- 0x32 = 50 = 1 star
- 0x34 = 52 = 1.5 stars
- 0x38 = 56 = 1.5 stars
- 0x3C = 60 = 2 stars
- 0x3D = 61 = 2 stars
- 0x3F = 63 = 2.5 stars
- 0x43 = 67 = 2.5 stars
- 0x44 = 68 = 3 stars
- 0x48 = 72 = 3 stars
- 0x4C = 76 = 3.5 stars
- 0x53 = 83 = 4 stars
- 0x54 = 84 = 4.5 stars
- 0x58 = 88 = 4.5 stars
- 0x5C = 92 = 5 stars
I really don't feel like making coherent ranges out of this, and honestly it doesn't even matter.

Types are still at the same little spot (which is now 0x58):
- 00 = Base Hero
- 01 = Level I Hero
- 02 = Level II Hero
- 03 = Builder
- 04 = Keep
- 05 = Mill
- 06 = Mine
- 07 = Barracks
- 08 = Checkpoint
- 09 = Spawner
- 0A = Default Tower
- 0B = Fire Tower
- 0C = Ice Tower
- 0D = Lightning Tower
- 0E = Earth Tower
- 0F = Cave and Bridge
- 10 = NOTHING
- 11 = Dragon (and Rock Monster)
- 12 = Minion (and Shadow Kai and Generics)

0x5A-0x5B is build cost. 0x5C-0x5D is build time (in frames, with this game running
at 30 FPS).

0x62-0x63 is health. 0x64-0x65 is magic.

0x68-0x69 is the projectile ID, then 00. For units without a projectile, this is FF FF.

0x6A-0x6D is damage. Like in the original, the first two bytes are the start of the
damage range, and the second two bytes are the size of it (so end = start + size).

0x6F seems to be a unit's attack speed. Like in the original, this refers to the time between
attacks, so lower is better. Since the buildings use 1E = 30 like in the original, we can assume
this is in frames (and, again, this game runs at 30 FPS).

The two magic powers of a unit are at 0x76 and 0x77. Unlike in the original, magic is displayed in
the actual order of these bytes. Given that there are five 00's after this, I would not be surprised if
it was possible to give units more than 2 powers.
