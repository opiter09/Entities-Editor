Types are still at 0x58:
- 00 = level 1 hero
- 01 = level 2 hero
- 02 = level 3 hero

0x62-0x63 is health. 0x64-0x65 is magic.

0x5A-0x5B is build cost. 0x5C-0x5D is build time (in frames, with this game running
at 30 FPS).

0x6A-0x6D is damage. Like in the original, the first two bytes are the start of the
damage range, and the second two bytes are the size of it (so end = start + size).
