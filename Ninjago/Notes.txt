Types are still at the same little spot (which is now 0x58):
- 00 = Base Hero
- 01 = Level I Hero
- 02 = Level II Hero
- 03 = Builder
- 04 = Keep
- 05 = Mill
- 06 = Mine
- 07 = Barracks
- 08 = Checkpoint
- 09 = Spawner
- 0A = Default Tower
- 0B = Fire Tower
- 0C = Ice Tower
- 0D = Lightning Tower
- 0E = Earth Tower
- 0F = Cave and Bridge
- 10 = NOTHING
- 11 = Dragon (and Rock Monster)
- 12 = Minion (and Shadow Kai and Generics)

0x62-0x63 is health. 0x64-0x65 is magic.

0x5A-0x5B is build cost. 0x5C-0x5D is build time (in frames, with this game running
at 30 FPS).

0x6A-0x6D is damage. Like in the original, the first two bytes are the start of the
damage range, and the second two bytes are the size of it (so end = start + size).

All four of those bytes are 00 for Ranged units. The projectile ID should be somewhere around here.

The two magic powers of a unit are at 0x76 and 0x77. Unlike in the original, magic is displayed in
the actual order of these bytes. Given that there are five 00's after this, I would not be surprised if
it was possible to give units more than 2 powers.
