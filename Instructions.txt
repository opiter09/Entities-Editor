If you read my documentation on Entities.ebp, you will find the following instructions:

HOW TO ACTUALLY EDIT ALL THIS STUFF:
1. Legally back up your LEGO Battles cartridge, yielding a .nds ROM file
2. Download CrystalTile2 (https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/818/)
3. Use it to extract the files from the ROM (i.e. load it, go to Tools -> NDS File
   System, and inside that window do File -> Split Rom)
4. Download the Decompressor Thing, hacked into being by yours truly
   (https://github.com/opiter09/Hacky-LZ11-Container-De-Compressor)
5. Drag and Drop the file BP / Entities.ebp you got from the ROM onto our decompressor
6. You will see an empty window, just close it. Now you have a testD.bin
7. Open that up in a Hex Editor, do whatever you want to it
8. When you want to put it back into the ROM, first compress it by dragging it onto
   HackedNitroPaint.exe again. This will again give you a window to close, and the file
   testC.bin
9. Rename testC.bin to Entities.ebp, then open CrystalTile2 again
10. Load your ROM into it, go to File -> NDS File System. For convenience, click
    View a list of -> Directory to show files inside folders instead of in one
    gigantic list. Then scroll down to BP -> Entities.ebp
11. Left click the file to select it, then right click, press Import, and choose your
    edited file
12. Now save the ROM. CrystalTile2 is weird, so you have to save by trying to quit and
    then clicking No to cancel. Then quit for real to be done

Step 7 is where this program comes in. Instead of going insane traversing through a hex file, you have a nice GUI to edit all the values.
In order to run this program, you need MurgaLua (RIP John Murga). It has been preserved at https://github.com/igame3dbill/murgaLua.
All you need to do is download that archive (using the green button Code -> Download Zip, or some other method), extract it, and
find bin / YourOperatingSystem / murgaLua. Then place that somewhere easy to get to, and put in the same spot:
- EntitiesEditor.lua
- your decompressed Entities file, testD.bin
- said murgaLua file
Now drag and drop my lua script onto murgaLua, or run it from the command line, and you should be good to go!

IMPORTANT: If you switch tabs, you will lose all unsaved work! Make sure to Save to the ROM before moving to a different section!
