This project is a GUI allowing for simple editing of the file Entities.ebp, from the NDS video game LEGO Battles. It runs using MurgaLua, found at 
https://github.com/igame3dbill/murgaLua (RIP John Murga). Instructions on how to use this can be found in Instructions.txt.

This repo serves as a more bleending-edge version of, and additional preservation for, Entities Editor as it exists on RomHacking.net:
https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/1682/

Finally, in the "Ninjago" folder you will find a similar GUI to edit this game's sequel, LEGO Battles: Ninjago. The instructions for it
are the same as with the original. The exception is that you do not need to put a whole ROM into the folder, since internal.txt
handles names.
