# Entities.ebp-Editor
This project is a GUI allowing for simple editing of the file Entities. ebp, from the NDS game LEGO Battles. It runs using MurgaLua, found at https://github.com/igame3dbill/murgaLua (RIP John Murga). A more comprehensive installation guide will come later, when this is actually finished.
